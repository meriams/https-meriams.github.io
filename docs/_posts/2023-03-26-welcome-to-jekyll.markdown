The dataset offers a glimpse into San Francisco's public safety over the years, containing detailed records of police incident reports spanning back to 2003. From incidents of theft and vandalism to more serious offenses such as assault and homicide, the dataset covers a wide range of criminal activity and incidents that have occurred in the city. With information on the date, time, location, and other relevant details for each reported incident, the dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and law enforcement agencies alike, providing insights into crime patterns, trends, and policy decisions.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
